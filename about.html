		<h2>We are WCIS 1238 Radio, here's some information about us!</h2>
		<p>WCIS 1.238 is an eclectic radio station in the greater Grand Rapids area in West Michigan. We host a wide variety of DJ’s, each with their own unique music style. Tune in any time to discover new and old tunes!</p>

		<p>Check back regularly for updates on where we’ll be in the upcoming months and new song recs from our DJ’s. Join our mailing list for monthly updates, so you don’t miss out on any of the fun. Kowabunga!!
		</p>
		
		<p>Our radio station began 30 years ago when our five founding DJ’s teamed up to create the most variety in music anywhere in West Michigan. This was before Spotify, before YouTube, before Limewire. The people wanted to listen to more than the Top 10 songs on the radio, and wanted more than the albums they could buy in stores. So we delivered. </p>
		
		<p>WCIS 1.238 varies in genre from indie to hip hop, k pop to EDM. We are happy to take recommendations from our community for new songs to play, and have moved our previous successful call-to-request system to an online forum. If you want to hear something on WCIS 1.238, let us know!</p>
